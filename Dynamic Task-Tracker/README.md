# Task tracker app

A responsive task tracker application that allows users to enter a task and date and time to complete the task using React.

This project is setup on Visual Studio Code and hosted on firebase. The aim of the project is to demonstrate my ability to create a CRUD application using React.

I use React features such as props and hooks (specifically State) to allow a user to add and remove tasks as they please . Jsx is used which allows my html to co-exist with javascripts and React code. This makes the application a bit more flexible while building the UI.
